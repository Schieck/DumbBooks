# DumbBooks
A dumb and simple way to prioritize and save your favorite books!

# How it works?
Import your book lists (With one name for each line in the .txt file), add it`s authors, if you want, and save it all in a JSON!

## HTML & CSS
To organize something you need to keep the design simple and clean, for that *Bluma* and *FontAwesome* were the chosen options.

## JS
Just *Lodash* will help us, it`s enough.
